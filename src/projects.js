    description:
      "I worked in an Agile Devops Team. My main project involved deploying a UI to automate and manage hundreds of weekly deployments for 250+ engineering employees. As Index Exchange manages its own servers, the goal of this tool was to provide a tool that was fully integrated with existing source control and pipelines. As such, it would provide an all-encompassing overview of all the jobs and deployments that were done at what time, what Ansible jobs failed and what succeeded, and who was responsible for what. This involved writing CI/CD pipelines for syncing data, writing Ansible playbooks and helm charts, creating new Docker images, and managing deployment to Kubernetes clusters.",
    learned:
      "This was my first co-op experience. As such, not only did I get an introduction to the completely different world of Devops, I also learned about common software tools such as Jira and Confluence."
